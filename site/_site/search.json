    "text": "This is the website for the R/Medicine 2022 pre-conference short course Introduction to R for Clinical Data.\nYou’ll learn about Quarto, a framework for reproducible data science, and how to perform essential data science tasks such as data import, visualization, transformation, and communication.\nFor the best experience, we suggest the following (none of the below are absolutely necessary!):\n\nIf available to you, use two monitors (or another two-screen setup such as a laptop and a tablet or two laptops).\nTo avoid issues caused by overzealous firewalls, you may want to connect from a personal (not work-issued) device using a non-work wireless network.\nPlease use a recent version of macOS or Windows - we have had issues with Linux.\nWe highly recommend you use the Google Chrome browser to access the RStudio Server training environment.\n\nThe entire course will be recorded and made available to registered R/Medicine 2022 conference participants for replay. To protect the privacy of participants, no breakouts, video feeds, or chats will be recorded. We also request that you refrain from recording or screen-grabbing any part of the course."
